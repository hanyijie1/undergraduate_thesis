## [1]Studies of multiphoton production of vacuum-ultraviolet radiation in the rare gases

Measurements of the vacuum-ultraviolet (<80-nm) radiation produced by intense ultraviolet (248-nm) irradiation (1015–1016 W/cm2) of rare gases have **revealed** the copious presence of both **harmonic radiation and fluorescence from excited levels**. **The highest harmonic** observed was the seventeenth (14.6 nm) in Ne, the shortest wavelength ever produced by that means. Strong fluorescence was seen from ions of Ar, Kr, and Xe, with the shortest wavelengths observed being below 12 nm. Furthermore, radiation from inner-shell excited configurations in Xe, specifically the $4d^95s5p$ → $4d^{10}5s$ manifold of $Xe^{7+}$ at ~17.7 nm, was detected. These experimental findings, in alliance with other studies concerning multielectron processes, **give evidence for a role of electron correlations in a direct nonlinear process of inner-shell excitation.**

## [2]Plasma perspective on strong field multiphoton ionization
  
During strong-field multiphoton ionization, a wave packet is formed each time the laser field passes its maximum value. **Within the first laser period after ionization there is a significant probability that the electron will return to the vicinity of the ion with very high kinetic energy.** **High-harmonic generation, multiphoton two-electron ejection, and very high energy above-threshold-ionization electrons are all conssequences of this electron-ion interaction.** One important parameter which determines **the strength of these effects** is the rate at which the wave packet spreads in the **direction perpendicular** to the laser electric field; another is the **polarization** of the laser. It will be essential for experimentalists to be aware of these crucial parameters in future experiments.

三步模型描述了高次谐波生成的三个关键步骤：

1. **电离**：强激光场使原子或分子的电子通过隧道效应电离。
2. **加速**：电子在激光场的驱动下加速，沿特定轨迹运动。
3. **再碰撞与辐射**：电子返回并与母离子再碰撞，释放高能光子，形成高次谐波。

这一模型在强场原子物理学中具有重要意义，尤其是在阿秒科学和超快光谱领域。

## [3]Route to phase control of ultrashort light pulses

A feasibility study of controlling the carrier phase in ultrashort light-wave packets emitted by a sub-10-fs laser is reported. An experimental apparatus capable of exploring the phase sensitivity of nonlinear-optical interactions is presented.

## [4]Frontiers in Ultrashort Pulse Generation: Pushing the Limits in Linear and Nonlinear Optics

Optical pulses in the 5-femtosecond range are produced by a variety of methods. Although different in technical detail, each method relies on the same three key components: spectral broadening due to the nonlinear optical Kerr effect, dispersion control, and ultrabroadband amplification. The state of the art of ultrashort pulse generation is reviewed with a focus on **direct laser oscillator schemes**.
