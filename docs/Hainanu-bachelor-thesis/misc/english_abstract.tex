In the study of the interaction between ultrashort femtosecond lasers and atoms and molecules, the strong-field approximation and the Coulomb-Volkov wave approximation are important tools for revealing the ultrafast dynamics of electrons. Based on the Coulomb phase correction theory of strong field ionization time-domain interference, this paper realizes the multi-parameter scanning and momentum spectrum analysis of planar composite waves by constructing the mean square error characteristics and order optimization strategy of the multi-order Adams-Bashforth integration scheme.

In this paper, the time-domain interferency-related transition amplitude calculation, momentum spectrum structure analysis and energy spectrum analysis for monochromatic linear polarization field, orthogonal bicolor field and non-orthogonal bicolor field systems have been completed, revealing the relevant regulation law of the Coulomb potential on the angular distribution characteristics of photoelectrons through the time-domain interference mechanism. The results show that by introducing Coulomb phase correction and parametric scanning analysis, the Coulomb-Volkov wave approximation model based on time-domain interferometry regulation can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of the photoelectron momentum spectrum in the high-energy region during the periodic and intra-periodic ionization processes dominated by time-domain interferometry, and induce the anisotropy of the angular distribution of ionized electrons.

In terms of numerical calculation, this paper integrates the selection of variable-order integral order, compilation strategy and cache mechanism optimization.

The parallel computing and standardized data processing module of the central processing unit provide high-precision computing tools and systematic analysis solutions for the study of attosecond scale electron dynamics, especially the regulation of the interaction between the light field and coulomb based on strong field ionization time-domain interference.
